If you are attending the course all the course materials and preparation
instructions are

## Are you wanting to update or use the slide code?

This repository is split into 3 areas:

-   [RMarkdown files and dependency
    files](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/tree/main) -
    slides have been built in {xaringan} which requires the css, img and
    libs folder to render
-   [html
    pages](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/tree/gh-pages) -
    are automatically rendered using GitHub actions (no need to knit
    every file!) and are kept on a separate branch. The html files are
    published though GitHub
    [here](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/intro_r/) and being
    {xaringan} they are interactive and accessible
-   [data
    files](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/tree/26a2e39bd49d4aa95a8efc5b45c398386e6e4ed4)
    are in a separate repository to help learners access the data files
    separate to the code for the slides
