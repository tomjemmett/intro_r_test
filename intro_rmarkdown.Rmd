## 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The document can include text, embedded R code, and graphics. You can insert an R code chunk by using the "insert" button above. A code chunk looks like this:


```{r}

```

You can name a chunk (optional), like so 

```{r name-of-chunk}

```

Typically, the first code chunk would be a "setup" chunk (the name is important). This may include global settings (explained later) and perhaps a list of libraries used:


```{r setup}

# Global chunk settings. Explained later.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)

```


The next chunk should be familiar; it's our code to import the beds data we worked with earlier. I've pasted in code from our R script, but you could write the code from scratch (or use the "Import Dataset" button as before).  


```{r load-data}

beds_data <- read_csv("beds_data.csv",
                      col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%d/%m/%Y")),
                      skip = 3)


```


The "play" button in the top right-hand corner of a chunk, will execute the "setup" chunk, together with the contents of the current chunk. Alternatively, we can select the lines we wish to execute and press Ctrl + Enter.

### Text

Text headings can be created with #. (The number of # indicates the level of the heading)

### Plotting MH bed availabilty 

As before, we will manipulate the beds data to create a time series of the mean number of beds. We will include our basic plot of the results in the same chunk. If you run the chunk, the plot will be displayed in line with the code (i.e. below the chunk). 

Note: If the objects required are created in chunks that you have not run before, you will get an error. (The button to the left of "play" will run all chunks above the current one.) 

```{r}

beds_ts <- beds_data %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_beds = mean(beds_av, na.rm = T))


ggplot(beds_ts) +
  geom_line(aes(date, mean_beds))+
  geom_point(aes(date, mean_beds))


```

### Generate document

Let's produce a report. By clicking on the drop down menu beside the **Knit** button, you can choose the output format. When you click **Knit**, a document will be generated (note: first time you do this, you'll be prompted to name your file. Try "test_rmarkdown"). As PDF requires additional software, we will knit to HTML (web page), which is the default.

**! GO AHEAD AND KNIT THIS DOCUMENT !**

You will immediately notice that the document includes both the code, and the console output for code chunks. In many cases, we won't want to include code, or the corresponding R output. 

We can remove these unnecessary sections by setting our chunk options correctly. Chunk options are set in the braces, like so

```{r options1, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(beds_ts) +
  geom_line(aes(date, mean_beds))+
  geom_point(aes(date, mean_beds))+
  ylim(0, 350)

```

The `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

We can also make use of the `include = FALSE` option, which means neither code nor the result are displayed in the document . 

```{r options2, include=FALSE}

# This colourful plot will not be shown, because of the option include=FALSE
# (the code will still be executed)

ggplot(beds_ts) +
  geom_line(aes(date, mean_beds), colour = "red")+
  geom_point(aes(date, mean_beds), colour = "green")+
  ylim(0, 350)



```

### Global chunk options

If you revisit the "setup" chunk at the top of the page, and uncomment the line 

`# knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` 

your R code will not be included in the final document - by default.

**!KNIT AGAIN TO SEE THE RESULT !**

One final thing: You'll see that the code and output from the "setup" chunk is still visible at the start of the document. Remove this by changing the options in the "setup" chunk to `include = F`.

**!KNIT ONE FINAL TIME !**
